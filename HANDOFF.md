# DocChat session handoff

Updated: 2026-10-01. Branch: `master` (merged from `chore/inference-complete-and-hardening`).
Current checklist: [tasks/todo.md](tasks/todo.md).

## Status

The authorized codebase hardening and measurement work is complete. Auth gaps,
folder ownership and default-secret startup refusal were already committed before
this session. SSE whitespace preservation and frontend decoder/build were also done.
This completion pass covers:

- Configured chat history limit, removed dead YouTube API key setting.
- Lazy Qdrant URL, reused HTTP client per event loop, API/MCP shutdown cleanup;
  retrieval query embedding runs in a worker thread.
- Original user question survives all planner rewrites; synthesis and critique use it.
- Partial context truncation searches within the body and preserves citation labels.
- Independent CPU embedding batches, off-loop ingestion indexing, shared source
  deletion/replacement; successful shorter re-ingests leave no orphan chunks.
- Bounded uploads (50 MiB by default), ordered awaited PDF progress, startup recovery
  of queued/running jobs left by restart; temp files cleaned on failure.
- Dependency-aware health (503 if DB or Qdrant fails), bounded per-IP auth/chat limits,
  atomic refresh rotation and user-wide refresh-session revocation on replay.
- Critic JSON failure warnings; benchmark no longer scores parse fallback as good.
- Real-corpus retrieval comparison and both requested redesign specs.
- Current docs/skills reconciled with one source_chunks collection and independent
  embeddings; historical audit/design claims clearly marked as provenance.

## Verification

- `venv/bin/ruff check .`: All checks passed!
- `venv/bin/python -m pytest -m "not eval" -q`: 368 passed, 8 deselected.
  13 warnings from python-jose's deprecated UTC timestamp helper.
- `cd frontend && npm test -- --run`: 3 test files, 6 tests passed.
- No frontend code changed in this completion pass; existing SSE build is retained.
- Approved live critic diagnostic using OpenAI `gpt-5.5`, reasoning=none,
  temperature=0, max_completion_tokens=150, fallback disabled: 5/5 edge cases,
  15/15 corruptions, 20 requests, no errors/parse failures, every finish_reason=stop.
  Report: [critic benchmark](reports/critic-benchmark-gpt55.md), raw JSON alongside.
  This was a per-run override; persistent provider/model config was not changed.
- Retrieval eval: 24 real-corpus questions, 17 chunks from the PDF declaration and
  Wikipedia RAG article. Recall@3 dense 0.8750, lexical 0.9792, cross-encoder 1.0000.
  Cross-encoder ranking averaged 1.17 seconds on CPU; production ranker unchanged.
  [Report](reports/retrieval-evaluation.md), golden labels and raw rankings retained.

## Operational limits

One application worker is the current model. Job recovery, in-memory IP limits,
and source-write locks are process-local; use shared ownership/queue/limiter before
scaling to independent workers. Qdrant delete plus batched upsert is not transactional;
retry failed indexing jobs. Replay revokes refresh tokens, not existing access JWTs.

A production restart requires a real JWT_SECRET_KEY (or DEBUG=true for local dev).
The prior running Compose app lacked that setting; do not expose the shipped key.
Host-side scripts must use localhost:6333 and Postgres port 5433, rather than Docker's
qdrant/postgres DNS names. Do not read/print .env secrets in session output.

## Explicitly deferred

No GPU pod was created in this session. Phase 3 quantization and Phase 4 batching
live sweeps remain deferred by the user's choice; specs and dry-run tooling are done.
Last recorded GPU pod was terminated and an empty pod list confirmed in that session.
The retained network volume owdj19ss50 (50GB, US-TX-3) has cached Qwen weights and its
own storage charge; user chose to keep it. Do not delete it without a specific go.

Grounding verdict/removal and context-aware critic redesigns stop at these specs:
- [Grounding](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-grounding-verdict-design.md)
- [Critic context/ablation](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-critic-context-ablation-design.md)

They contain concrete paired quality/latency experiments. No production redesign or
critic-on/off quality-lift claim has been made. A 20/20 classification diagnostic is
not evidence that the retry loop improves end-to-end answers.

## History and next action

All current authorized checklist items are complete. The hardening branch was pushed
and merged into the repository's default `master` branch without conflicts. Merge
commit `77a2abb` is published on `origin/master`. Checks on the integrated branch:
368 Python tests passed, 6 frontend tests passed, and Ruff clean.
Unrelated `Claude outputs/` is untouched.
